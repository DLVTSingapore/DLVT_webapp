      "paragraph1": "The Dennis Lee Ving Tsun Academy in Singapore is proudly accredited by the Hong Kong SAR Government, dedicated to upholding the esteemed lineage of Grandmaster Ip Man. Our academy embraces a disciplined and methodical approach to Ving Tsun instruction, guided by a structured grading system. Each disciple is nurtured according to their unique progress and aptitude, ensuring a tailored path to mastery. Through careful assessment, those who attain the requisite standards are honored with certification, fostering a journey of learning and practice rooted in tradition and purpose.",
      "paragraph2": "Ving Tsun is a principle-driven Chinese martial art, blending steadfastness with adaptability and gentle power through relaxation. Anchored yet pliable, it absorbs or redirects external forces. As a method of self-defense, Ving Tsun employs both strikes and grapples, excelling in close-quarters combat with a focus on simultaneous offense and defense. It cultivates a deep awareness of bodily motion, drawing from muscles, core, tendons, and joints, and its forms greatly enhance proprioception. From a stable, grounded stance, all attacks and counterattacks are launched, believed to deliver greater impact when the practitioner is firmly rooted. This philosophy guides my path to mastery.",
      "paragraph3": "It is my honor to have studied as a disciple under Grandmaster Ip Ching, the second son of the revered Grandmaster Ip Man, during the 1990s. Through Grandmaster Ip Ching’s tireless dedication and selfless guidance, my understanding and mastery of Ving Tsun have deepened immeasurably. Coupled with my own diligent practice and study, this mentorship has enriched my knowledge and skill in this venerable martial art.",
      "paragraph4": "Inspired and guided by the wisdom of Grandmaster Ip Ching, I humbly accepted the role of Honorable Trainer at the Ving Tsun Ip Ching Athletic Association, under the auspices of the Auxiliary Medical Service, beginning in 2005. This esteemed position has been the foundation for my commitment to imparting the principles of Ving Tsun to the younger generation, fostering their growth in this revered martial art.",
      "paragraph5": "With the esteemed recognition of Grandmaster Ip Ching, I was privileged to contribute to the 2009 RTHK programme “Kung Fu Quest,” serving both as an actor and an advisor. Additionally, in Grandmaster Ip Ching’s classes, I had the honor of acting as a translator for international disciples, facilitating their learning. These invaluable experiences have profoundly enriched my understanding and proficiency in Ving Tsun. Through my steadfast dedication and deep reverence for this martial art, I was entrusted with the role of Director at both the Ving Tsun Athletic Association and the Ving Tsun Ip Ching Athletic Association since 2010, a responsibility I hold with great humility."
